        <strong>Letter of Recommendation – Systems Administrator</strong>
        <em>(Click to expand)</em>
      </summary>

   <div style="margin-top: 1rem; line-height: 1.6;">

   <strong>Letter of Recommendation</strong>

   <p>To Whom It May Concern,</p>

   <p>
          I am writing to formally recommend <strong>Dylan Murray</strong> for employment in a
          <strong>Systems Administrator or IT Infrastructure</strong> role.
        </p>

 <p>
          Dylan currently serves in a <strong>remote Systems Administrator (SysAdmin)</strong> position under my supervision,
          where he is directly involved in the setup, configuration, administration, and ongoing management of a
          <strong>production server environment</strong>. His work is hands-on and operational in nature, supporting live services
          with real considerations for uptime, performance, stability, and security.
        </p>

   <p>
          In this role, Dylan has demonstrated working knowledge and practical experience in the following areas:
        </p>

 <ul>
          <li>Linux server administration, including service management, permissions, log analysis, and troubleshooting</li>
          <li>Virtualization platforms, including virtual machine management, resource allocation, and stability monitoring</li>
          <li>Containerized services, including Docker-based deployments</li>
          <li>Networking fundamentals, including IP addressing, port management, firewall rules, and connectivity troubleshooting</li>
          <li>Service availability and uptime monitoring</li>
          <li>System troubleshooting and root-cause analysis</li>
          <li>Remote systems administration best practices</li>
          <li>Change management and configuration updates performed without disrupting production services</li>
        </ul>

   <p>
          Dylan consistently demonstrates a strong problem-solving mindset. When issues arise, he approaches them
          methodically, researches solutions independently, tests changes responsibly, and follows problems through
          to resolution. He works effectively in a remote environment, communicates clearly, and can be trusted to
          manage systems with minimal oversight.
        </p>

   <p>
          Although Dylan does not currently hold formal IT certifications, his real-world experience, reliability,
          and technical aptitude more than compensate. He has proven to be resourceful, persistent, and capable of
          learning new systems quickly—qualities that are essential for any successful Systems Administrator.
        </p>

   <p>
          One of Dylan’s greatest strengths is his sense of accountability and ownership. He treats systems as
          production assets rather than experiments and understands the importance of stability, documentation,
          and operational discipline.
        </p>

  <p>
          For professional context, I have over <strong>seventeen years of experience</strong> in enterprise and military IT
          operations and currently hold the <strong>CompTIA Advanced Security Practitioner (CASP+ / Security-X)</strong>
          certification. Based on my experience, I am confident that Dylan possesses the foundational skills,
          judgment, and work ethic required to succeed in a professional SysAdmin environment.
        </p>

 <p>
          I strongly recommend Dylan Murray for <strong>entry-level to mid-level Systems Administrator,
          Infrastructure Support, or Technical Operations</strong> roles. With continued experience, I am confident
          he will continue to grow into a highly capable and dependable IT professional.
        </p>

   <p>
          Please feel free to contact me if additional information is required.
        </p>

          <strong>Respectfully,</strong><br>
